# Friend App

[Demo](https://vladk96.github.io/friends-app/)

This is a home-work of kottans course.
In this home-work  I created a tiny social friends' search page with users cards, search, sorting and filtering of them by age, name or whatever you want with [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/).

# Functionality of my tiny App

* see cards list of users on the page;
* searching by typing name in search input and see immediately filtering on the page
* sorting cards by name/age in A-Z/Z-A ways
* filtering friends by age, by name

# What I used

1. HTML5, CSS3.
2. Vanilla JS.
